# esedb-rs
Extensible Storage Engine database library for Rust

This is a minimal, mostly proof-of-concept library for querying for data in ESE databases.

Currently it only supports these types of operations:
  - read column
  - seek
  - select index
  - update
  
Notably, it does not support adding rows or modifying the database schema yet.
Pull requests are welcome and appreciated, but I am not actively developing this library any further at this time.
